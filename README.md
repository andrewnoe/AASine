## AASine

This is a VST made with C++, JUCE, and the Maximillian library.

Its main goal is to be a simple two oscialltor synth with a sine wave and white noise, and includes an ADSR envelope and frequency filter.

I created this because a sine modulated with white noise is the starting point for a lot of synth sounds I like to use in my production, so I wanted to make a "stock plugin" for myself so to speak.
